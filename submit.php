        Maybe one day there will be more gardens. Do you have an idea for one? If so, please send me a haiku, poem, quote, or short description of an ideal garden.
        Maybe I will illustrate your garden and upload to the site. Maybe this website will get updated more frequently than once every nine years. Who knows.
