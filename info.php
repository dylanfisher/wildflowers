      <p>There are many similarities between gardens and websites. They both evolve over time and you can design them how you would like. Sometimes, something unexpected happens, and the garden returns a different result than what you expected. Perhaps they both can encourage you to slow down and appreciate the change of seasons.</p>

      <p>Wild Flowers is an illustrated series of imaginary gardens originally inspired by the quote, “Garden as though you will live forever,” by William Kent. Initially, the series was several notebooks filled with lively marker drawings. I wanted to see if I could translate that same feeling of an energetic sketch onto the web browser. A reflection on analog verus digital, if you will. All under the pursuit of pleasure.</p>

      <p>Botanical illustrations have a long, scientific history. While these illustrations are not technical, they’re continuing the tradition of floral drawings and questioning what a fictional scene looks like online.</p>

      <p>This website has been online since 2016. It has been updated only once so far — today, which is March 15th, 2025. A lot has changed since then. I wonder what else will when I decide to water the garden once again...</p>
