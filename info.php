      <p>Wild Flowers is an illustrated series of imaginary gardens originally inspired by the quote, “Garden as though you will live forever,” by William Kent. Initially, the series consisted of two illustrations printed on velvet fine art paper. This website is the digital component to the project.</p>
      <p>Botanical illustrations have a long, scientific history. While these illustrations are not technical, they’re continuing the tradition of floral drawings and questioning what a fictional scene looks like online.</p>
